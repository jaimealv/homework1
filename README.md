# Carta - A Modern Capitalization Table


## Overview and Origin

Carta is a FinTech startup based in Palo Alto that provides capitalization table software for companies to keep track of their ownership and valuation. It was founded in 2012 by Henry Ward and Manu Kumar after Kumar noticed the dificulty of keeping track of equity in private companies. They have received a total funding of $447.8 million so far, with the latest round coming from Series E funding totaling $300 million led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. 

## Business Activities

Through its seven years of existence, Carta has been growing its toolset in helping in managing equity and valuation, but its initial goal was to digitalize stock certificates for private companies. This had been a tideous process for many years, but companies that have gone public had already began doing so many years back. 

As Carta began expanding and growing its list of users, it started providing additional services that further help companies keep track of their equity, prompting the company to change its name from eShares to reflect the changes. One of this was creating a capitalization table that was always up to date. Previously, it was hard for companies to update their cap tables as transactions were done by hand and records were kept in paper. The process of buying and exercing shares was also time consuming because most of the time they relied on their legal firms to handle the paperwork. In fact, legal firms were the ones who kept most of the stock certificates and updated the cap tables for their clients. This also added to the cost of managing share equities as legal firms charged fees for every transaction involving shares. For early stage companies, these bills to organize cap tables were often the highest in their total legal bill. Due to the length and cost of managing cap tables, most of them are wrong as they're usually outdated. 

With the complicated system in place before, employees were the ones that were negatively impacted. For one, most of them have no  knowledge of how equity shares work and how to exercise them. Carta's cap table management creates a hub where employees can track their ownership in companies in real-time. They can view the total amount of shares that they own. Carta additionally started offering monthly subscriptions that calculates the fair market value of private companies. This functionality allows companies to keep track of their common stock prices to set their strike price. 

Among the list of services that Carta has been producing is fund administration to help venture capital with their quaterly reports. The portolio analytics made possible from this product enables better communication among investors and limited partners.

With the expanded list of services that Carta now offers, it is able to serve private companies, shareholders, investors, and employees. They have created a hub in which all players can be updated on their share holdings at any time and can make any changes regarding their equity in their respective companies. Carta has made the process of selling, buying, and exercising their stock options accessible to everyone. 

With so many different types of players benefitting from Carta's resources, one can imagine that their market size is quite large. Indeed that is the case. When Carta first began as eShares, it did so with the intention of helping those that had ownership in private companies. As more and more companies became interested in their product, they realized the actual scope that involves ownership. 

For exmple, private company have their own shareholders, which many times come from venture capital firms. These firms have their own investors that come as limited partners (LPs), and these LPs have their own investors as well. Carta predicts that this model can be used in other forms of investment such as real estate, pension fun, oil reserves, and more. 

Managing large amounts of data requires the best that software development has to offer and the tools that enable them. Carta chose to use Django for its platform. Django is a Python-based framework that is able to accomplish complicated tasks with minimal coding. 

## Landscape

Due to the nature of Carta's business model, in which they provide a platform for companies, investors, and employees to keep track of their equity, its domain in fintech is more closely aligned with investment management. Its services lets those who have invested time and money maintain a record of the performance of the company and facilitates the process of buying, selling, or exercising their stock options. Similarly, it enables an updated valuation of a company, which can be helpful for those invested in a company to keep track of their fair share in the case that the company goes public, goes through a merger and acquisitions, or receives more funding. 

FinTech is all about big data. It is easy to see why the investment management sector would be interested in emerging technologies related to fintech such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, among others. The advancements in data analytics have increased the speed at in which portfolio managers can make decisions. Investment firms can also use artificial intelligence to go through the vast amounts of data and have automated trading systems based on global economic factors. 

There are a numbers of startups in this domain that have focused on equity management as well, such as Captable.io and Shareworkss. They have been facilitating the issue of stocks electronically as well as providing cap tables, but they are still behind Carta in many aspects. For example, Carta offeres 409A valuations in their plans, which are appraisals of the fair market value of a company. These valuations are helpful to know the price of a stock at any time, which makes sure their cap tables are always up to date. This also helps them provide scenario modeling in case someone wants to exercise an option, or if the company plans to raise funding.

## Results

Carta has been instrumental in helping private company move away from paper stock certificates into digital. They are firm believers in the push to move those records electronicale in order for its users to always be updated. Therefore a key metric in their work is tracking how many shareholders are in their platform, which are over 700,000. From those numbers they also track from how many different companies are taking advantage of their service, as well as how many of those shareholders come from venture firms. Together, all users of Carta's services manage a total of $575 billion in assets. In comparison, Shareworks has over 10,000 users of its platform, while Captable.io has 50,000. Shareworks was acquired by Solium in 2017, a company that had been doing stock administration on public company. It will be interesting how this partnership will develop and how Carta will be responding.
